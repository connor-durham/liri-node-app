# Goal

The goal of the Liri app is to create four seperate functions that can be called from the Command Line for different tasks. The functions are as follows:
  
   1) "spotify-this" If you select this function and include the name of an artist, it will return their name, a preview of         their album, and a name of the track.
   2) "movie-this" If you select this function and include the name of a movie, it will return the title, year of release,            IMDB rating, movie rating (PG-13), the country it's from, the language, a brief plot description, and list of actors
   3) "concert-this" If you select this function and include the name of an artist, it will return the name of a venue, the         city the venue is in, and the date of the show (it returns data for five separate shows)
   4) "random-this" If you select this function, it will read the "random.txt" file and check which function was selected and        which song or artist was selected
